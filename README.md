# Generative-AI-product-placement
This project uses AI to remove backgrounds from product images and generate realistic scenes where the product is naturally placed. The goal is to create high-quality product images for e-commerce without manual editing.

To use this tool, first, install the required dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

~bash

git clone https://github.com/Avishin0418/Generative-AI-product-placement.git  
cd Generative-AI-product-placement

  
# Install the necessary Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt  


The AI model used for background generation is Stable Diffusion Inpainting. If not downloaded, it will be loaded automatically when running the script.

#Run the script:

python script.py  

The program will ask for an input image of a product. It will remove the background and then generate a realistic background to blend the product into a natural-looking scene. The final output will be saved in the output folder.

No need to manually edit product images anymoreâ€”just upload, process, and get high-quality images instantly.
